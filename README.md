# an-employee-turnover-analysis-project
This self-directed project currently includes one report and one *Random Forest* model.

In this report, an analysis leveraging Python studies the complex dynamics of employee turnover by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, visualization, and predictive modelling.

*Notes: This is a record of my professional journey. More files, such as reports in different languages and Python code, might be added later.*
